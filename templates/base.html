                <p>Our research project aims to develop a Covid-19 image classification model using deep learning techniques. We collected a large dataset of chest X-ray and CT scan images from Covid-19 patients and healthy individuals. We then used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to train and test our model. Our results showed that our model achieved an accuracy of over 95% in classifying Covid-19 images from healthy images.</p>

            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>Our Covid-19 image classification model can accurately detect Covid-19 cases from chest X-ray and CT scan images with an accuracy of over 95%. This is a significant improvement over traditional diagnostic methods, which are often time-consuming and require specialized equipment.</p>
            <p>We have integrated our model into a web application, which allows users to upload chest X-ray and CT scan images for classification. The application also provides users with information about Covid-19 and its symptoms, as well as links to relevant resources.</p>
